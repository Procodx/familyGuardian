# FAMILY GUARDIAN – Simple Explanation Document

## Why We Are Building This

Rape and sexual assault are sadly happening all around us. It’s not something anyone should ignore, and it’s personal when it affects people we love.

This app is designed to **help protect our family from sexual assault** by:

- Reducing response time during emergencies
- Helping loved ones know where you are if something goes wrong
- Preserving critical evidence if needed
- Giving confidence and peace of mind

This is a **family protection system**, not a business and not for public use for now.

# What The App Does

## 1️⃣ Guardian Mode (Always On, But You Control It)

When installed, Guardian Mode is active by default.

- It quietly monitors movement patterns for unusual situations.
- Keeps minimal background tracking active.

You can **turn Guardian Mode OFF anytime**. Nothing is hidden. Everything is transparent.

---

## 2️⃣ Emergency Trigger

If something feels unsafe — for example, a threat of sexual assault — the user can:

- Press the power button quickly three times
or
- Use a special shortcut

Immediately, the app will:

- Send live location to trusted contacts
- Send SMS alert (even without internet)
- Notify the central family monitor
- Begin recording audio securely
- Share live movement

No complicated steps. No unlocking needed.

## 3️⃣ Automatic Protection (If User Can’t React)

If something unusual happens — for example:

- Sudden rapid movement (like being forced into a vehicle)
- Unexpected stop after movement
- Route deviation at night
- Possible fall or forceful movement

The phone will:

1. Vibrate silently
2. Show a 10-second confirmation
3. If no response → send emergency alert automatically

This helps in cases where the person is shocked, restrained, or unable to react.

---

## 4️⃣ Low Battery Protection

If battery becomes low:

- The system notifies trusted contacts
- Sends last known location
- Increases monitoring sensitivity

If the phone suddenly powers off outside a safe location:

- The system flags it immediately

This helps reduce risk if the phone dies during an incident.

---

# What The App Does NOT Do

- Does NOT secretly spy on anyone
- Does NOT hide from the user
- Does NOT allow remote control
- Does NOT share location publicly
- Does NOT notify strangers

Only trusted family members receive alerts.

---

# Privacy & Control

- You can see who monitors you
- You can disable Guardian Mode anytime
- All recordings are encrypted
- Data is only accessible to trusted contacts
- No data is sold or shared

Transparency is non-negotiable.

---

# Why It Matters

Sexual assault can happen quickly. Every minute counts.

Even reducing response time by 2–3 minutes can make a life-saving difference.

Even having the last known location can help law enforcement or trusted contacts act.

Even preserving audio evidence can help prevent perpetrators from escaping justice.

This system does **not guarantee safety**, but it **increases protection and confidence** for you and your loved ones.

# Future Possibility (Optional Later)

If many people use the app in the future:

- Nearby verified users may be alerted during emergencies
- Emergency agencies may be integrated

But this will only happen after:

- Legal review
- Security hardening
- Proper approval

For now, this is **family-only**.
